# Next.js project structure

Comfortable and scaled structure (in my opinion)

## app/components folder

#### `/elements` - Includes all reusable components.
#### `/layouts` - Includes all layouts.
#### `/module` - Components which we can't refer to the pages (like Navigation Bar or Footer).
#### `/screens` - Includes page components (We use /pages folder purely for routing).
